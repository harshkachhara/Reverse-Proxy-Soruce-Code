## Installation

To get started with FireSocks, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/harshkachhara/Reverse-Proxy-Soruce-Code/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system and execute it to install the application.

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
- Basic knowledge of proxy servers and their configurations

## Usage

After installation, launch the FireSocks application. You will be greeted with a clean interface that guides you through the setup process. 

### Starting the Application

1. Open the FireSocks application.
2. Choose the type of proxy server you want to manage.
3. Follow the prompts to configure your server settings.

## Configuration

Setting up your proxy server is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Select Proxy Type**: Choose from HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS.
2. **Enter Server Details**: Input the IP address and port number of your proxy server.
3. **Authentication**: If your proxy requires authentication, enter your credentials.
4. **Save Configuration**: Click on the save button to store your settings.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "proxyType": "HTTPS",
  "server": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.1",
    "port": 8080,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass"
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Connections

FireSocks allows you to monitor active connections easily. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Navigate to the **Connections** tab in the application.
2. View the list of active connections, including IP addresses and connection status.
3. Use filters to sort connections based on criteria such as duration or status.

### Connection Overview

- **IP Address**: Displays the remote IP address.
- **Status**: Shows whether the connection is active or inactive.
- **Duration**: Indicates how long the connection has been active.

## Custom Proxy Client Generation

One of the standout features of FireSocks is its ability to generate custom proxy clients. Follow these steps to create your own:

1. Go to the **Client Generation** section in the application.
2. Select the type of client you want to create (e.g., for Windows, macOS).
3. Customize the settings, such as proxy type and authentication.
4. Click on the generate button to create your client.

### Generated Client

The generated client will include all necessary configurations, allowing users to connect to your proxy server seamlessly.
